# 🗂️ My Drive Clone (Backend Practice Project)

This project is my **first backend practice project**, where I learned how to build a mini Google Drive–like app using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Supabase**.  
It helped me understand how file uploads, user authentication, and routing work together in a real-world backend application.  

💡 **Big thanks and shoutout to [Sheriyans Coding School]([https://www.youtube.com/@sheriyans](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc7gpqMnnOSbU_F2-5MVVZw))** — I followed their YouTube tutorials to make this project possible 🙌
